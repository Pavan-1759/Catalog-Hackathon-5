# Catalog-Hackathon-5
This project is a console-based Electronic Voting System developed in Python, designed to ensure secure, anonymous, and tamper-proof voting. The system allows for voter registration, secure authentication, and encrypted vote casting. It includes features like vote encryption, prevention of double voting, and real-time display of election results, making it suitable for small-scale elections where integrity and fairness are paramount.
